You are given an array of strings tokens that represents an arithmetic expression in a Reverse Polish Notation.

Evaluate the expression. Return an integer that represents the value of the expression.

Note that:

The valid operators are '+', '-', '*', and '/'.
Each operand may be an integer or another expression.
The division between two integers always truncates toward zero.
There will not be any division by zero.
The input represents a valid arithmetic expression in a reverse polish notation.
The answer and all the intermediate calculations can be represented in a 32-bit integer.





intuition -  create a array where our final result will be stored. In res array add those token elements which are not operators(+,-,*,/).
             if operator come perform the operation on the last two elements of res and delete those elements. At last the res will only contain a single element.
             return the only element thst is in zeroth index.

class Solution:
    def evalRPN(self, tokens: List[str]) -> int:
        res=[]
        for i in tokens:
            if i not in {'+','-','*','/'}:
                res.append(int(i))
            else:
                a,b=res.pop(), res.pop()
                if i=='+':
                    res.append(a+b)
                elif i =='-':
                    res.append(b-a)
                elif i =='*':
                    res.append(a*b)
                else:
                    res.append(trunc(b/a))
        return res[0]
