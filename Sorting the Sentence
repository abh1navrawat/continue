A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces. Each word consists of lowercase and uppercase English letters.

A sentence can be shuffled by appending the 1-indexed word position to each word then rearranging the words in the sentence.

For example, the sentence "This is a sentence" can be shuffled as "sentence4 a3 is2 This1" or "is2 sentence4 This1 a3".
Given a shuffled sentence s containing no more than 9 words, reconstruct and return the original sentence.




intuition - when u split s it will become array. A array have a length, so make a 0 indexed array with its length. We have to take int in the loop otherwise it will give error(one is string and other is int).
            i[:-1] will remove the number from the word. Join command make the list a string again.




class Solution:
    def sortSentence(self, s: str) -> str:
        s=s.split()
        p=[0]*len(s)
        for i in s:
            p[int(i[-1])-1]=i[:-1]
        return ' '.join(p)
