You are standing at position 0 on an infinite number line. There is a destination at position target.

You can make some number of moves numMoves so that:

On each move, you can either go left or right.
During the ith move (starting from i == 1 to i == numMoves), you take i steps in the chosen direction.
Given the integer target, return the minimum number of moves required (i.e., the minimum numMoves) to reach the destination.




intuition - Just take steps in the positive direction. Once the total exceed the target break the first loop then in another loop check whether the total-target is even or not. If so return the total no. of steps
            Otherwise keep on taking steps until the difference between the total and target becomes even. 

            We need to find even diff because the diff/2 should be a whole number. Whatever diff/2 is, if we flip that number(take the step in opposite direction we will get the required target.

            if the number is target is 5, then 1+2+3 will give 6
            6>5, 6-5 =1 cant do 1/2, so need to take extra step
            1+2+3+4=10, 10-5=5 but cant do 5/2, so extra step
            1+2+3+4+5=15, 15-5=10 if we divide 10/5 we get awhole number.
            We can flip +5 to −5
            0+1+2+3+4−5=5   and 5 is the target

    def reachNumber(self, target: int) -> int:

        while total < target:
            step += 1
            total += step
        
        while (total - target) % 2 != 0:
            step += 1
            total += step
