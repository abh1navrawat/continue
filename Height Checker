A school is trying to take an annual photo of all the students. The students are asked to stand in a single file line in non-decreasing order by height. Let this ordering be represented by the integer array expected where expected[i] is the expected height of the ith student in line.

You are given an integer array heights representing the current order that the students are standing in. Each heights[i] is the height of the ith student in line (0-indexed).

Return the number of indices where heights[i] != expected[i].




intuition -  Create a array in which you will store the height array in increasing order. We will iterate i over the range of height\expected 
             and we will check if ith height and ith expected is not same then we will increase s by one. At last we will return s.





class Solution:
    def heightChecker(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
        exp = sorted(heights)
        s=0
        for i in range(len(heights)):
            if heights[i]!=exp[i]:
                s+=1
        return s
