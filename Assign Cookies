Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.

Each child i has a greed factor g[i], which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size s[j]. If s[j] >= g[i], we can assign the cookie j to the child i,
and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.





intuition - question did not state that the lists are sorted so first sort them. We have to define i and j because we are using while not for. If size of cookie is greater than greed then there will be increment
            in i. If this size of cookie doesn't satisfy the greed then we will go to the next cookie(increment in j).





class Solution:
    def findContentChildren(self, g: List[int], s: List[int]) -> int:
        s.sort()
        g.sort()
        i,j=0,0
        while i < len(g) and j<len(s):
            if g[i]<=s[j]:
                i+=1
            j+=1
        return i
