You are given two strings s and t.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to t.



intuition - Count will return the number of the time the element is present in the string. It is given in the question, only 1 element is added in t. So that would not be present in s.
            Every time count will be 1==1, except the time later added element comes then it will be 0==1 which will let us return i.



class Solution:
    def findTheDifference(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        for i in t:
            if s.count(i) != t.count(i):
                return i
