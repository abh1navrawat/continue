A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors, excluding the number itself. A divisor of an integer x is an integer that can divide x evenly.

Given an integer n, return true if n is a perfect number, otherwise return false.

intuition -  We will make a variable named res and add a the divisors of num. and we will create a variable named s in which we will store how many divisors are of 
             num. If s is gerater than zero and res is equal to nums yhan return True otherwise False.
class Solution:
    def checkPerfectNumber(self, num: int) -> bool:
        s=0
        res=0
        for i in range(1,num):
            if num % i ==0:
                res=res+i
                s+=1
        if s>0 and res==num:
            return True
        else:
            return False
