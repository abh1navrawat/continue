Given an integer numRows, return the first numRows of Pascal's triangle.

In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it as shown:





intuition -  In every pascal triangle first layer is of 1. We have already created a layer of we will iterate it on numRows - 1. Create a array(row) in which 1 is theonly element. 
             Now insert elements in row. Atlast of every row add 1 as an element because in pascal triangle every row ending has 1 in it. Append row to res and return res.




class Solution:
    def generate(self, numRows: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        res=[]
        res.append([1])
        for i in range(numRows-1):
            row=[1]
            for j in range(i):
                row.append(res[i][j]+res[i][j+1])
            print(row)
            row.append(1)
            res.append(row)
        return res
