Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

 

intuition - In this question return the middlemost element of sorted nums (because majority element is greater than [lens(nums)/2].


class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        s = sorted(nums)
        m = len(s)//2
        return s[m]
