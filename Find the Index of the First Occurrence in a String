Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.





intuition - find searches the index where the it was first occurred. just return that otherwise it will return -1





class Solution:
    def strStr(self, haystack: str, needle: str) -> int:
        if needle in haystack:
            return haystack.find(needle)
        return -1
