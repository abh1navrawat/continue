Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

 
 
 
 def isSameTree(self, p: Optional[TreeNode], q: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        if p is None and q is None:
            return True
        elif p is None or q is None:
            return False
        else:
            if p.val == q.val:
                return self.isSameTree(p.left, q.left) and self.isSameTree(p.right, q.right)
            else:
                return False
