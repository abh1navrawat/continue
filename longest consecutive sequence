Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.






intuition -  first of all sort the list. Create a list with its length equal to nums. use for loop ranging from 1 to length of nums(its should start form 1 because
             every iteration will check the previous element, so the first iteration will check the first element). If nums - 1 is equal to the previous element of
             nums then add it to result array, atlast return max of result to find longest substring.



(33/72) testcases passes-
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        res=[1]*len(nums)
        for i in range(1,len(nums)):
            if nums[i-1]==nums[i]-1: 
                res[i]+=res[i-1]
        return max(res)






intuition -  create a set with the same elements of nums. Initialize a variable to store the length of the longest sequence found so far to 0.
             For each element in the input array, do the following:
             a. If the element is the start of the sequence (i.e., the element-1 is not present in the hash set), do the following:
                i. Initialize a variable to store the length of the current sequence to 1.
                ii. Keep incrementing the element by 1 and checking if the next element is present in the hash set.
                iii. If the next element is present in the hash set, increment the length of the current sequence by 1.
                iv. If the length of the current sequence is greater than the length of the longest sequence found so far,
                    update the length of the longest sequence found so far.
             Return the length of the longest sequence found so far.





class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        num_set = set(nums)
        longest_seq = 0
        
        for num in num_set:
            if num-1 not in num_set:
                current_num = num
                current_seq = 1
                while current_num+1 in num_set:
                    current_num += 1
                    current_seq += 1
                longest_seq = max(longest_seq, current_seq)
                
        return longest_seq
                
        return longest_seq
