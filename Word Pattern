Given a pattern and a string s, find if s follows the same pattern.

Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in s.





intuition - use split keyword on s to make an array of differt words that are separated by whitespace. If the len of both given str(now converted to array) is not equal, return false. 
            Also convert in set and then check it will remove duplicate elements. Now start inserting key value pair in dict. Dictionary will take s element as key and pattern as value.





class Solution:
    def wordPattern(self, pattern: str, s: str) -> bool:
        x=s.split(' ')
        y=dict()
        if len(x) != len(pattern):
            return False
         if len(set(x)) != len(set(pattern)):
            return False
        for i in range(len(x)):
            if x[i] not in y:
                y[x[i]]=pattern[i]
            elif y[x[i]]!=pattern[i]:
                return False
        return True
