You are given a string s and an integer k. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. 
You can perform this operation at most k times.

Return the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations.



error - passing 23/39 testcases. Fault is that it doesn't check the already checked elements.

intuition -  we will use enumerate ,then the next line do the same thing of adding that key and value to the dictionary,
             otherwise creating key and value for it.

            d[char] = d.get(char, 0) + 1
            if window+1 - max(d.values()) <= k:
                window += 1
            else:
                d[s[i-window]] -= 1
        
        return window
