Given a fixed-length integer array arr, duplicate each occurrence of zero, shifting the remaining elements to the right.

Note that elements beyond the length of the original array are not written. Do the above modifications to the input array in place and do not return anything.




intuition - WE can't use for loop in this otherwise it will only return list of 0s after encountering a 0. Instead of using append we need to use insert because we need to specify the postion.
            After encountering a zero we need to increase i twice otherwise it will keep inserting 0s.




class Solution:
    def duplicateZeros(self, arr: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify arr in-place instead.
        """
        i=0
        while i<len(arr):
            if arr[i]==0:
                arr.insert(i+1,0)
                arr.pop()
                i+=1
            i+=1
