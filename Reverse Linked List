Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.



intuition - we will create a node that will store the first value after the linked list is reversed. So we will start it with None (because first head will become last at the end that will point to nowhere).
            Initiate a while loop what will break when head is False(None). We want temp to store the head.next beacuse the new head.next will store node. Node will become head and we will move to next element.

            1 -> 2 -> 3 then,     None <- 1  2 -> 3, then      None <- 1 <- 2  3 then    None <- 1 <- 2 <- 3




# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        node = None

        while head:
            temp = head.next
            head.next = node
            node = head
            head = temp
        
        return node
