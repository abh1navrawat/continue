Given the array of integers nums, you will choose two different indices i and j of that array. Return the maximum value of (nums[i]-1)*(nums[j]-1).



intuition - Just do the sorting in descending order and return the product of 1st and 2nd element of the newly sorted nums(1st and second will be biggest elements).

class Solution:
    def maxProduct(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums.sort(reverse=True)
        p,q=nums[0]-1,nums[1]-1
        return p*q
