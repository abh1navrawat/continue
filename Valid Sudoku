Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition




intuition -  create a result array. Loop i and j in the range of 9. Create a variable named element that contains board ith and jth element. 
             Now there will be 3 tuples, first tuple contains element if i and row index. Second contains element of j and row index. 
             3rd element represent 3x3 grid. If element is not equal to ".",then add it to result array. At last check whether the length of array result and length
             of set result is same.

    def isValidSudoku(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> bool:

        for i in range(9):
            for j in range(9):
                element = board[i][j]
                if element != '.':
                    res += [(i, element), (element, j), (i // 3, j // 3, element)]
        return len(res) == len(set(res))
