Given an integer n, return the number of prime numbers that are strictly less than n




intuition - memory limit exceeded, we can make a list of prime numbers. Its better than to check each number one by one.




class Solution:
    def countPrimes(self, n: int) -> int:
        p=[2]
        if n==0 or n==1:
            return 0
        for i in range(3,n):
            for j in p:
                if i%j!=0:
                    p.append(j)
        return len(p)
