739. Daily Temperatures

Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures, return an array answer such that answer[i] is the number of days you have to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.

 

Example 1:

Input: temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]
Output: [1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]
Example 2:

Input: temperatures = [30,40,50,60]
Output: [1,1,1,0]
Example 3:

Input: temperatures = [30,60,90]
Output: [1,1,0]
 

Constraints:

1 <= temperatures.length <= 105
30 <= temperatures[i] <= 100

Solution: BruteForce: TLE : O(n^2) 
Explanation: Iterating in nested loop where i is current element and j find the greater element of current ele, 
i starts from 0 to n-1, j starts from i+1 to n:


class Solution:
    def dailyTemperatures(self, temperatures: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        answer=[]
        for i in range(len(temperatures)-1):
            for j in range(i+1,len(temperatures)):
                if temperatures[i]<temperatures[j]:
                    answer.append(j-i)
                    break
                if j==len(temperatures)-1:
                    answer.append(0)
        answer.append(0)
        return answer
