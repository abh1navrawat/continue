A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.





intuition - they are asking to apply binary search because of o(log n ) time complexity. THis Array does need to be sorted for binary search because there is no unique values to return. 
            We can return any value that satisfies the condition. We just need to return the number that that follows the condtion (subsequent low high low).





class Solution:
    def findPeakElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        l, r = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while l < r:
            mid = (l + r) // 2
            if nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]:
                r = mid
            else:
                l = mid + 1
        return l
