Given an integer array nums and an integer k, modify the array in the following way:

choose an index i and replace nums[i] with -nums[i].
You should apply this process exactly k times. You may choose the same index i multiple times.

Return the largest possible sum of the array after modifying it in this way.





intuition - Can be easily done by sorting twice. First sort to change all the negative elements to positive elements. Second sort If k is still greater than zero. We will keep applying the converting process on the
            smallest element.





class Solution:
    def largestSumAfterKNegations(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] < 0 and k > 0:
                nums[i] = -nums[i]
                k -= 1
        nums.sort()
        if k%2==1: 
            nums[0] = -nums[0]
        return sum(nums)
