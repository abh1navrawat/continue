The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,

F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1.
Given n, calculate F(n).




intuition - just make an array containing only 2 elements(0,1). Now iterate within the range of n-1. now keep adding last 2 elements of list and store it to variable s. 
            Append s to array f. After the end of the iteration return s.

            1 testcase will fail so make an if statement, that return 1 if n is 1 because if it returns s at normal iteration it will return zero. 


class Solution:
    def fib(self, n: int) -> int:
        s=0
        if n ==1:
            return 1
        f=[0,1]
        for i in range (n-1):
            s=f[-1]+f[-2]
            f.append(s)
        return s
