Given a string containing just the characters '(' and ')', return the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses substring.




intuition - Solved by using stack. Just keep storing the index of '('. If ')' appears then pop the stack and check which is bigger previously stored max_length or (curr_idx - top_stack). If the () are not 
            consecutive then the index of ( will be stored in the top of stack. start the stack with -1, and if popped insert the corrent stack otherwise couldn't pop it.

            We have start with -1 in stack because if the start of s contain '()' then 1-(-1) will give 2 which is what we require.



time complexity - O(n)

    def longestValidParentheses(self, s: str) -> int:
        max_length = 0
        stck=[-1]
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] == '(':
                stck.append(i)
                
            else:
                stck.pop()
                if not stck:
                    stck.append(i)
                else:
                    max_length=max(max_length, i-stck[-1])
                    
        return max_length
