You are given an integer array nums. You want to maximize the number of points you get by performing the following operation any number of times:

Pick any nums[i] and delete it to earn nums[i] points. Afterwards, you must delete every element equal to nums[i] - 1 and every element equal to nums[i] + 1.
Return the maximum number of points you can earn by applying the above operation some number of times.




intuition - Simplifying it to house robber problem. We have to get the maximum points. SO make a variable and storeall the copies of distinct integers in input array, then f[i] will store all the copies of 
            corresponding no. in input array. then it will automatically become house robber problem.





class Solution:
    def deleteAndEarn(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        f=[0]*(max(nums)+1)
        for n in nums:
            f[n]+=n
        c,p=0,0
        for i in f:
            c,p=max(p+i,c),c
        return c
