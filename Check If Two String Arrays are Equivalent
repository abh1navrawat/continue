Given two string arrays word1 and word2, return true if the two arrays represent the same string, and false otherwise.

A string is represented by an array if the array elements concatenated in order forms the string.




intuition - just make the elements of the array in a single string and compare it. With the use of join keyword. Easy level question in leetcode




class Solution:
    def arrayStringsAreEqual(self, word1: List[str], word2: List[str]) -> bool:
        word1 = "".join(word1)
        word2 = "".join(word2)
        return word1 == word2
