You are given row x col grid representing a map where grid[i][j] = 1 represents land and grid[i][j] = 0 represents water.

Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells).

The island doesn't have "lakes", meaning the water inside isn't connected to the water around the island. One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.





intuition - if its a area of land perimeter will be 4 oherwise 0. if land is connectect to any other land decrease the perimeter by 2. Its a matrix so we have use nested loops. It will subtract extra 2 from 
            perimeter so in if condition we have to use i>0 and j>0.

class Solution:
    def islandPerimeter(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        perimeter=0
        for i in range(len(grid)):
            for j in range(len(grid[0])):
                if grid[i][j]==1:
                    perimeter+=4
                    if i>0 and grid[i-1][j]==1:
                        perimeter-=2
                    if j>0 and grid[i][j-1]==1:
                        perimeter-=2
        return perimeter
