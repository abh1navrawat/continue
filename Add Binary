Given two binary strings a and b, return their sum as a binary string.




intuition - if i and j greater than or equal to zero and carry if carry is greater than 0, while loop continues.if i or j greater than or equal to zero we will add it to the value of carry and decrease the value
            of i or j respectively. after every if statement we will append remainder of carry if divided by 2 to a array. We will also perform floor division on carry.Atlast we will return the reversed
            array but it will become string after using hte join keyword.




class Solution:
  def addBinary(self, a: str, b: str) -> str:
    s = []
    carry = 0
    i = len(a) - 1
    j = len(b) - 1

    while i >= 0 or j >= 0 or carry:
      if i >= 0:
        carry += int(a[i])
        i -= 1
      if j >= 0:
        carry += int(b[j])
        j -= 1
      s.append(str(carry % 2))
      carry //= 2

    return ''.join(reversed(s))
