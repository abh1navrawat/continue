Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.



intuition - just storing the max height from left side and from the right side. for example , n=[1,0,1,3,2] after updating it for max pillar we get [1,1,1,3,3]. Have to perform same from the right side.
            After that just reverse the right max to fix order. Second for loop is used to calculate the position of water at ith index.




class Solution:
    def trap(self, n: List[int]) -> int:
        x,y=[n[0]],[n[-1]]
        a=0
        for i in range(1,len(n)):
            x.append(max(n[i],x[-1]))
            y.append(max(n[-i-1],y[-1]))
        y.sort(reverse=True)
        for i in range(len(x)):
            a+=n[i]-min(x[i],y[i])

        return -1*a
