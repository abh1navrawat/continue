Given an array Arr[] of N integers. Find the contiguous sub-array(containing at least one number) which has the maximum sum and return its sum.




intuition - Cannot use nested loops it will show TLE, so create two variable one with smallest value oher zero. Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm is an iterative dynamic programming algorithm.
            It calculates the maximum sum subarray ending at a particular position by using the maximum sum subarray ending at the previous position.





        p=float('-inf')
        q=0
        for i in range(0,N):
            q=q+arr[i]
            if q>p:
                p=q
            if q<0:
                q=0
        return p
